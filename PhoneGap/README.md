## The Realtime Framework Cloud Messaging
Part of the [The Realtime® Framework](http://framework.realtime.co/messaging), Realtime Cloud Messaging is a secure, fast and highly scalable cloud-hosted Pub/Sub real-time messaging system for web and mobile apps.

If your website or mobile app has data that needs to be updated in the user’s interface as it changes (e.g. real-time stock quotes or ever changing social news feed) Realtime Cloud Messaging is the reliable, easy, unbelievably fast, “works everywhere” solution.

## The PhoneGap example
This example uses the Realtime Cloud Messaging JavaScript SDK to connect, send and receive messages through a Realtime® Server in the cloud.

It subscribes a channel and allows you to send a message to that channel. When the message is sent you will receive it back and it will be displayed.

Just zip the files (don't forget to enter your Realtime application key) and upload it to the [Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) to build your PhoneGap mobile app. 

> NOTE: For simplicity this sample assumes you're using a Realtime® Framework developers' application key with the authentication service disabled (every connection will have permission to publish and subscribe to any channel). For security guidelines please refer to the [Security Guide](http://messaging-public.realtime.co/documentation/starting-guide/security.html). 
> 
> **Don't forget to replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY` with your own application key. If you don't already own a free Realtime® Framework application key, [get one now](https://app.realtime.co/developers/getlicense).**
