## The Realtime Framework Pub/Sub messaging system
Part of the [The Realtime® Framework](http://www.realtime.co/solutions/realtimeframework), ORTC (Open Realtime Connectivity) is a secure, fast and highly scalable cloud-hosted Pub/Sub real-time messaging system for web and mobile apps.

If your website or mobile app has data that needs to be updated in the user’s interface as it changes (e.g. real-time stock quotes or ever changing social news feed) ORTC is the reliable, easy, unbelievably fast, “works everywhere” solution.

## The PHP sample app
This sample app uses the Realtime® Framework Pub/Sub PHP library to authenticate a user and send a `Hello World` message through a Realtime® Server in the cloud.

You might want to use this sample together with the JavaScript sample app in order to receive the sent message in a different browser.
