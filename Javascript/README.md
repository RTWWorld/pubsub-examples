## The Realtime Framework Pub/Sub messaging system
Part of the [The Realtime® Framework](http://www.realtime.co/solutions/realtimeframework), ORTC (Open Realtime Connectivity) is a secure, fast and highly scalable cloud-hosted Pub/Sub real-time messaging system for web and mobile apps.

If your website or mobile app has data that needs to be updated in the user’s interface as it changes (e.g. real-time stock quotes or ever changing social news feed) ORTC is the reliable, easy, unbelievably fast, “works everywhere” solution.

## The JavaScript sample app
This sample app uses the Realtime® Framework Pub/Sub JavaScript library to connect, send and receive messages through a Realtime® Server in the cloud.

In fact this sample is a fully functional developers console. It's very useful to debug your Realtime applications (e.g. subscribing channels to inspect the content of messages published by other applications).

> NOTE: For simplicity this sample assumes you're using a Realtime® Framework developers' application key with the authentication service disabled (every connection will have permission to publish and subscribe to any channel). For security guidelines please refer to the [Security Guide](http://docs.xrtml.org/pubsub/overview/2-1-0/security.htm). 
> 
> **Don't forget to replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY` and `YOUR_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY` with your own application key. If you don't already own a free Realtime® Framework application key, [get one now](https://app.realtime.co/developers/getlicense).**
